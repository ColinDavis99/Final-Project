Introduction
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Welcome to our Program!
This Repository contains the contents of (Sean Maglione, Colin Davis, Scott Barber) Final 
Project for CSC 212

Instructions
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Any g++ compiler IDE --> Version 1.0
Have QT IDE with MinGW Compiler Downloaded --> Version 2.0
Download Final-Project-Main.zip
Extract Files (Desktop is recommended)
Double click on "String_Search_I QT Project File" (.Pro file)
Once opened in QT IDE click "configure" in order to build and run project

Understanding UI
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
After clicking the green play button located in the left corner of the screen, the user will
be presented with a interactive model of the program.

Here, the user will enter a string to search for inside of full character, symbols, phrases 
etc.
                                      
                                              OR

Be able to enter a .txt file of their choice

Proceeding further, the user will have the option to choose which sorting algorithm, account 
for capital letters, as well as supressing the output of thefound indexes when inputting 
large files.

When the Rabin-Karp Search is ran, the user will then be prompted with a display of the time the
search took, how many matches were found, as well as the hash value of the inputted string

When the Boyer-Moore Search is ran, the user will then be prompted with a display of the bad
characters in a table format, demonstrating how the formula operates within the table.

Graphing Window
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
When Graph results is chosen, the user will be presented with a graph concerning the Runtime 
in microseconds compared to the number of characters searched.
    
This Graph will display the runtime of both algorithms, Rabin-Karp symbolized as Green and 
Boyer-Moore as Red 

The user will also be able to alternate between the Graphing Window and the Main Screen 
located at the top left of the window

Any amount of searches is allowed
   
An option for removing the previous search is also located at the top right of the window
